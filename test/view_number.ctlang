Feature: View a Number    
  In order to view the friendly name of a number
  As an end user
  I want to list numbers and view the friendly name the first one

  Scenario: List available numbers and view friendly name of one

    Given my test setup runs    
    When I list all available numbers
    And "NumberA" friendly name configured as "Zarbat"
    Then "NumberA" should have friendly name "Zarbat"
